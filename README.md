Start of a web based app to help with world building, ie conceptualize characters and their relationship, locations, plot idea .. yada..yada. I started this because I needed something more than a notes app to keep track of characters idea, pictures and how they are interconnected.

The end goal workflow being something like:
  - Write a general concept of appearance, roleplaying/traits, relationship/conncections
  - Send appearance description to an image generator (Stable Diffusion for example)
  - Write a short background
  - Push button for LLM feedback/ideas
  - Plot a social graph showing connections to family members, hechmen, hirelings and etc.
  - Be able to upload short stories, or snippets and have an LLM evaluate against the background summary or traits information
  - Upload a pictures and have it interrogated to generate the apperance summary
  - Why not have an AI co-pilot? Some sort of interactive dialog to come up with character concept
