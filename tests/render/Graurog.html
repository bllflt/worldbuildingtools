    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Graurog, a formidable figure standing at seven feet tall and weighing 400 pounds, was born into a rare mixed heritage of ogre and orc, which set her apart in the orcish clans of the Grukag plains. Trained by her chieftain father as an enforcer, she wielded the Glarok, a heavy battle axe, with prowess uncommon for a female in orc culture. However, her life took unexpected turns when her father arranged her marriage to the chieftain of a neighboring clan, leading to a series of perilous encounters with Dragonborn brigands, High Elf scouts, and treacherous alliances. Eventually sold into slavery to Baron Thomas McLeod, she endured harsh conditions until she seized an opportunity to escape, finding refuge in the Markanian forest where she crossed paths with Yerucham during a brawl with satyrs. This chance encounter marked the beginning of a new chapter in her tumultuous life.
